/// agent (Security Agent) sees when scoping a task's tool set.
///
/// Design notes:
/// - **Fail-closed.** Any tool name not recognized here is treated as both destructive and
///   open-world (the most cautious classification). New built-in tools therefore default to
///   "risky" until explicitly classified, and MCP tools — which are never in this table — fall
///   back to their (untrusted) server-supplied hints via `MCPBridgedTool`.
/// - These are *facts* about tools we author, not hints. Unlike MCP annotations, the security
///   agent may rely on them as accurate.
/// - Only `destructive` / `openWorld` are surfaced to Security Agent (per design); `readOnly` and
///   `idempotent` are deliberately not modeled here.
